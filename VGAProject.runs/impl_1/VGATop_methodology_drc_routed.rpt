2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch i_vga_project/rightLimit_reg[6] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin i_vga_project/rightLimit_reg[6]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch i_vga_project/rightLimit_reg[9] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin i_vga_project/rightLimit_reg[9]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch i_vga_project/rom_data_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin i_vga_project/rom_data_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch i_vga_project/rom_data_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin i_vga_project/rom_data_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch i_vga_project/rom_data_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin i_vga_project/rom_data_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch i_vga_project/rom_data_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin i_vga_project/rom_data_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch i_vga_project/topLimit_reg[8] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin i_vga_project/topLimit_reg[8]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
